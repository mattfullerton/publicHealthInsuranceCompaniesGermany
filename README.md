Name, States served, Internet address, Postal Address and Email Address of
public health insurances in Germany. To understand how the health system
in Germany works, please see [this Wikipedia article][wikipedia].

## Source

The data is sourced from a PDF made available by the [GKV-Spitzenverband][GKV]
from their [online database of health insurances][db]. The dataset is based on 
a version from 06.12.12, and already needs updating.

We started by doing everything manually, but then moved to extracting the data 
from the PDF using code from [this Gist][gist] which was then extended
to also find and parse the "Impressum" (Imprint/Legal contact information) of each site
and attempt to grab an email address, running on [ScraperWiki][swiki]. The extended script
is in the scripts folder. Missing emails, phone numbers and street addresses 
were taken manually. The working data set is on [Google Spreadsheets][gss].
